# Security and Constraint Implementation Specification

## Overview

The Valence Kernel implements a multi-layered security architecture that provides foundational security mechanisms without prescribing specific authorization policies. The system combines explicit account registration, capability-based access control, transaction-level atomicity, and configurable CPI restrictions to create a secure execution environment for complex blockchain applications.

## Guard Account Security Model

The Guard Account serves as the primary security configuration mechanism for each session, containing essential flags and parameters that control the session's interaction capabilities with external programs and accounts. Each session references exactly one guard account that defines its security posture and operational constraints.

The `allow_unregistered_cpi` flag represents the core security decision point for each session, requiring explicit opt-in for arbitrary Cross-Program Invocation capabilities. When set to false, sessions can only invoke programs that are either on the global allowlist or explicitly registered in the session's Account Lookup Table. When set to true, sessions gain the ability to invoke any executable program, subject to account access limitations.

Guard account creation occurs through the `CreateGuardAccount` instruction, which accepts the target session address and initial configuration parameters. The creation process validates that the caller has appropriate authority to create guard accounts and ensures that the guard configuration is properly linked to its associated session.

Guard account modification requires appropriate authority validation and follows the same security principles as initial creation. Changes to critical security flags like `allow_unregistered_cpi` generate audit events that can be monitored by security systems and compliance frameworks.

The guard account design intentionally minimizes complexity while maximizing security impact. Rather than implementing complex permission matrices or role-based access controls, the system provides a small set of high-impact security flags that protocols can compose into sophisticated authorization models.

## Account Registration and Access Control

Account registration through the Account Lookup Table provides the foundation for secure account access within the kernel. All accounts that a session may access must be explicitly pre-registered with specific permission designations that define the allowed access patterns.

Registration validation ensures that only authorized entities can register accounts for session access. The registration process verifies that the registering party has appropriate authority over the target account or explicit permission from the account owner to enable access.

Permission specification during registration uses access mode flags that define whether the session can read, write, or both read and write the registered account. These permissions are enforced at operation time, preventing sessions from performing unauthorized access even if they possess valid account references.

Account registration capacity limits prevent denial-of-service attacks that could exhaust system resources through excessive registration requests. Each Account Lookup Table can register up to 4 borrowable accounts, 4 programs, and 4 guard configurations, providing sufficient capacity for most use cases while maintaining system efficiency.

Registration persistence ensures that account permissions remain stable across session operations until explicitly modified. Changes to account registrations require appropriate authority and generate audit events for security monitoring and compliance verification.

The registration system prevents unauthorized account access by requiring explicit declaration of all accounts before they can be used in operations. This approach eliminates the remaining_accounts pattern common in other Solana programs, replacing it with a more secure and transparent pre-registration requirement.

## Cross-Program Invocation Security Layers

CPI security implements a three-layer validation system that provides defense in depth against unauthorized program invocation while maintaining operational flexibility for legitimate use cases.

The global allowlist maintains a system-wide registry of approved programs that any session can invoke without additional permissions. These programs undergo rigorous security review and are considered safe for universal access. The global allowlist includes essential system programs like the SPL Token program and other widely trusted components.

Session-specific program authorization through Account Lookup Table registration enables controlled access to programs not on the global allowlist. Sessions must explicitly register programs before invoking them, with registration requiring validation of program executability and appropriate authority.

Guard-controlled CPI provides the final layer of authorization for programs that are not globally approved or session-registered. Sessions with `allow_unregistered_cpi` enabled can invoke arbitrary programs, but this capability requires explicit opt-in through guard account configuration.

CPI validation occurs at invocation time, checking each program call against all three authorization layers. Programs that pass any layer of authorization are permitted to execute, while programs that fail all layers are rejected with appropriate error codes.

Account propagation through CPI operations maintains the same security boundaries established by the calling session. Invoked programs receive only the accounts explicitly provided by the caller and cannot access additional accounts beyond those authorized by the session's ALT registration.

The CPI security model enables protocols to balance security and functionality by choosing appropriate authorization strategies. Conservative protocols can disable unregistered CPI and rely solely on pre-approved programs, while innovative protocols can enable broader CPI access with appropriate risk management.

## Namespace Security and Isolation

Namespace security implements hierarchical access controls that prevent unauthorized cross-namespace operations while enabling legitimate administrative actions by parent namespaces.

One-way trust relationships ensure that parent namespaces can access child namespace resources while preventing child namespaces from accessing parent resources. This design creates natural privilege boundaries that align with organizational hierarchies and administrative structures.

Namespace validation during session creation ensures that new sessions can only be created within namespaces where the caller has appropriate authority. Parent namespace owners can create child sessions, while non-parent entities must demonstrate explicit authorization for namespace access.

Child account creation within namespaces follows the same hierarchical permission model, allowing sessions to create child accounts within their own namespace while preventing unauthorized account creation in foreign namespaces.

Namespace path validation prevents malicious path construction that could bypass security boundaries. The system validates path format, prevents directory traversal attempts, and ensures that all path components conform to acceptable naming conventions.

Cascade invalidation through namespace hierarchies respects security boundaries by validating authority at each level of the hierarchy. Invalidation operations can only cascade to child namespaces where the caller has appropriate administrative authority.

## Borrowing Semantic Security

Borrowing semantics implement exclusive and shared access controls that prevent concurrent access conflicts while enabling safe parallel operations within defined boundaries.

Borrow validation ensures that account access requests comply with pre-registered permissions and do not conflict with existing borrows by other sessions or operations. The system tracks all active borrows and prevents conflicting access patterns.

Access mode enforcement validates that borrowed accounts are used only in accordance with their registered permissions and current borrow status. Read-only borrows prevent any account mutations, while read-write borrows enable full access subject to ownership constraints.

Borrow lifetime management ensures that all borrowed accounts are properly released at the end of their intended usage period. Operations that fail to release borrowed accounts generate warnings and may be subject to automatic cleanup to prevent resource leaks.

Concurrent borrow detection prevents multiple sessions from obtaining conflicting borrows on the same account simultaneously. The system maintains global borrow state and rejects operations that would create access conflicts.

Borrow inheritance through operation sequences ensures that account access permissions remain consistent throughout batch operations. Borrowed accounts remain accessible to subsequent operations in the same batch until explicitly released.

## Transaction Atomicity and Consistency

Transaction-level atomicity ensures that all instructions within a transaction succeed completely or fail completely, preventing partial state corruption that could compromise system integrity.

State consistency validation occurs at transaction boundaries, verifying that all account modifications maintain system invariants and that no operations have created inconsistent states across the affected accounts.

Rollback mechanisms ensure that failed transactions leave no persistent state changes, maintaining system consistency even when complex operations encounter errors during execution.

Dependent operation validation ensures that operations within batch sequences maintain proper dependency relationships. Operations that depend on earlier operations validate that prerequisite conditions have been met before execution.

Cross-account consistency validation ensures that operations affecting multiple accounts maintain proper relationships between those accounts. Token transfers validate that balances remain consistent, while session operations ensure that parent-child relationships remain valid.

## Capability-Based Access Control

Capability-based security provides fine-grained access control through explicit capability tokens that grant specific permissions to sessions and operations.

Capability validation occurs at operation boundaries, verifying that the executing session possesses the necessary capabilities for the requested operations. Missing capabilities result in operation rejection with appropriate error reporting.

Capability delegation enables sessions to grant limited capabilities to other sessions or external programs, enabling controlled sub-delegation of authority within defined boundaries.

Capability revocation provides mechanisms for withdrawing previously granted capabilities, enabling dynamic permission management and response to security incidents.

Capability audit trails track all capability grants, uses, and revocations, providing comprehensive security logging for compliance and incident response purposes.

## Stack Constraint Security

Stack constraint enforcement prevents stack overflow attacks by validating operation complexity against available stack space before execution begins.

Operation complexity estimation calculates the expected stack usage for complex operations like cascading invalidation and batch execution, rejecting operations that would exceed available stack space.

Recursive operation limits prevent unbounded recursion that could exhaust stack space through cascading operations or deep CPI chains. The system enforces configurable depth limits and rejects operations that would exceed these boundaries.

Memory usage validation ensures that all operations remain within Solana's memory constraints, preventing operations that would require excessive heap allocation or could compromise system stability.

Error handling for stack constraint violations provides clear error messages that enable developers to restructure operations to fit within system constraints while maintaining desired functionality.

## Audit and Monitoring Framework

Security event emission generates structured log events for all security-relevant operations, enabling external monitoring systems to track system security posture and detect potential security incidents.

Operation logging captures detailed information about all executed operations, including account access patterns, CPI invocations, and permission grants or revocations.

Error event logging provides comprehensive information about security validation failures, enabling security teams to identify attack patterns and system misuse attempts.

Compliance reporting generates structured data suitable for automated compliance verification and regulatory reporting requirements.

Real-time monitoring hooks enable integration with external security monitoring systems that can provide immediate alerting and response to security events.

## Configuration and Policy Management

Security configuration management provides mechanisms for updating system security parameters while maintaining operational continuity and preventing security degradation.

Policy validation ensures that configuration changes maintain system security properties and do not introduce vulnerabilities or weaken existing security controls.

Gradual rollout mechanisms enable security configuration changes to be deployed incrementally with monitoring and rollback capabilities in case of issues.

Emergency security controls provide mechanisms for immediate response to security incidents, including capability revocation, session suspension, and enhanced monitoring activation.

Configuration audit trails maintain comprehensive records of all security configuration changes, enabling forensic analysis and compliance verification of security management practices.
