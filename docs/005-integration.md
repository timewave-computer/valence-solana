    subgraph "Integration Layers"
        A[Direct Function Calls]
        B[Shared State Access]
        C[Event Coordination]
        D[Configuration Management]
    end
    
    subgraph "Integration Patterns"
        E[Request-Response]
        F[Event-Driven]
        G[Pipeline Processing]
        H[Coordinated Transactions]
    end
    
    A --> E
    B --> G
    C --> F
    D --> H
```

## Core Integration Patterns

### Request-Response Pattern

Direct module interactions provide immediate responses between components. This pattern enables one module to call another with parameters and receive response data directly.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M1 as Module A
    participant M2 as Module B
    
    M1->>M2: function_call(params)
    M2->>M2: process_request()
    M2-->>M1: response_data
    M1->>M1: continue_processing()
```

Capability validation during execution demonstrates this pattern where the capabilities:: module validates access before calling the processor:: module for execution.

### Event-Driven Pattern

Event-driven coordination enables loose coupling and handles cross-cutting concerns through an event system that distributes notifications to multiple handlers.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Event Source] --> B[events::]
    B --> C[Event Handler 1]
    B --> D[Event Handler 2]
    B --> E[Event Handler N]
    
    C --> F[Module Response]
    D --> G[Module Response]
    E --> H[Module Response]
```

Session lifecycle events illustrate this pattern where the sessions:: module emits events that other modules listen for to update their relevant state.

### Pipeline Processing Pattern

Sequential data transformation flows through multiple modules where each stage processes the data and passes it to the next stage, often sharing state along the way.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Input] --> B[Module 1]
    B --> C[Module 2]
    C --> D[Module 3]
    D --> E[Output]
    
    B -.-> F[Shared State]
    C -.-> F
    D -.-> F
```

Capability execution demonstrates this pipeline where data flows through context preparation, verification, and function execution stages.

### Coordinated Transaction Pattern

Multi-module operations that must succeed or fail together use coordination to ensure consistency across module boundaries.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Coord as Coordinator
    participant M1 as Module A
    participant M2 as Module B
    participant M3 as Module C
    
    Coord->>M1: prepare_transaction()
    Coord->>M2: prepare_transaction()
    Coord->>M3: prepare_transaction()
    
    M1-->>Coord: ready
    M2-->>Coord: ready
    M3-->>Coord: ready
    
    Coord->>M1: commit_transaction()
    Coord->>M2: commit_transaction()
    Coord->>M3: commit_transaction()
```

Session creation with multiple state updates exemplifies this pattern where session state, capability bindings, and function registry must all be prepared before committing the transaction.

## Module Integration Patterns

### Capabilities and Sessions Integration

The capabilities:: module integrates with sessions:: by loading session state, validating permissions, executing with session context, and updating usage statistics. The sessions:: module creates sessions, emits events, and provides context for capability operations.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[capabilities::] --> B[Load Session State]
    B --> C[Validate Session Permissions]
    C --> D[Execute with Session Context]
    D --> E[Update Session Usage Stats]
    
    F[sessions::] --> G[Session Creation]
    G --> H[Emit Session Events]
    H --> I[capabilities:: Listens]
    I --> J[Update Execution Context]
```

The capabilities:: module accesses session state directly, validates permissions, builds execution context with session data, and executes capabilities within the session context.

### Capabilities and Verification Integration

Capabilities:: module requests verification from the verification:: module, which loads and executes verification functions, then aggregates results for capability validation.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Cap as capabilities::
    participant Ver as verification::
    participant VF as Verification Functions
    
    Cap->>Ver: request_verification(capability, context)
    Ver->>VF: load_verification_functions(capability.id)
    VF-->>Ver: verification_functions[]
    
    loop For each verification function
        Ver->>VF: execute_verification(function, context)
        VF-->>Ver: verification_result
    end
    
    Ver->>Ver: aggregate_results()
    Ver-->>Cap: combined_verification_result
```

The capabilities:: module gets required verifications, executes the verification chain, validates namespace access, and combines results for comprehensive capability validation.

### Functions and Verification Integration

Functions integrate with verification by loading function definitions, getting required verifications, executing verification chains, and proceeding with function execution only after verification passes.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Function Request] --> B[Load Function Definition]
    B --> C[Get Required Verifications]
    C --> D[Execute Verification Chain]
    D --> E{All Verifications Pass?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Execute Function]
    E -->|No| G[Return Error]
    F --> H[Return Function Result]
```

The function executor loads function definitions, creates verification input with context and parameters, runs verification chains, and executes functions only after successful verification.

## Cross-Module State Management

### Shared State Access Pattern

Modules access shared state through well-defined interfaces across session state, registry state, execution state, and configuration state.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Shared State Layer"
        A[Session State]
        B[Registry State]
        C[Execution State]
        D[Configuration State]
    end
    
    subgraph "Module Access Layer"
        E[Capabilities Module]
        F[Sessions Module]
        G[Functions Module]
        H[Verification Module]
        I[Events Module]
    end
    
    E --> A
    E --> B
    E --> C
    F --> A
    F --> D
    G --> B
    G --> C
    H --> B
    H --> C
    I --> C
    I --> D
```

State access is implemented through traits that provide consistent interfaces for loading registry state, session state, execution state, and configuration across all modules.

### State Consistency Patterns

State consistency is maintained through transaction coordination where modules begin transactions, update state, notify other modules of changes, validate changes, and commit transactions with proper coordination.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M1 as Module A
    participant SS as Shared State
    participant M2 as Module B
    participant M3 as Module C
    
    M1->>SS: begin_transaction()
    M1->>SS: update_state(changes)
    SS->>M2: notify_state_change()
    SS->>M3: notify_state_change()
    
    M2->>SS: validate_state_change()
    M3->>SS: validate_state_change()
    
    SS->>M1: commit_transaction()
    SS->>M2: state_committed()
    SS->>M3: state_committed()
```

## Event Coordination Patterns

### Event-Driven Module Coordination

Event coordination flows from event sources through an event bus and router to multiple module handlers that process events and emit response events.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Event Source] --> B[Event Bus]
    B --> C[Event Router]
    C --> D[Module Handler 1]
    C --> E[Module Handler 2]
    C --> F[Module Handler N]
    
    D --> G[Module Action]
    E --> H[Module Action]
    F --> I[Module Action]
    
    G --> J[Emit Response Event]
    H --> J
    I --> J
```

Event coordination systems maintain handler registries, emit events to appropriate handlers, and enable module event handler implementations that respond to specific event types by updating relevant state.

## Performance Integration Patterns

### Optimized Call Patterns

High-frequency calls are optimized through caching where cached results are returned immediately while uncached calls execute module operations and update the cache.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[High-Frequency Call] --> B{Cached?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Return Cache]
    B -->|No| D[Execute Module Call]
    D --> E[Update Cache]
    E --> F[Return Result]
    C --> F
```

Performance-optimized integration uses caches, metrics tracking, and efficient operation execution to minimize overhead in high-frequency module interactions.

### Batch Processing Integration

Batch processing coordinates multiple requests through request batching, batch validation, batch execution, batch state updates, and batch event emission to improve overall system throughput.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Batch as Batch Processor
    participant M1 as Module A
    participant M2 as Module B
    
    Client->>Batch: submit_batch_request()
    Batch->>Batch: collect_requests()
    Batch->>M1: batch_process_requests()
    M1-->>Batch: batch_results
    Batch->>M2: batch_post_process()
    M2-->>Batch: final_results
    Batch-->>Client: combined_results
```

Batch processors group requests by module, process module batches efficiently, and return combined results to improve performance for multiple related operations.

## Security Integration Patterns

### Permission Chain Validation

Security integration validates permissions through session permission checks, capability permission checks, function permission checks, namespace permission checks, and parameter validation before allowing execution.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request] --> B[Session Permission Check]
    B --> C[Capability Permission Check]
    C --> D[Namespace Permission Check]
    D --> E[Function Permission Check]
    E --> F[Parameter Validation]
    F --> G[Execute if All Pass]
    
    B -->|Fail| H[Security Event]
    C -->|Fail| H
    D -->|Fail| H
    E -->|Fail| H
    
    H --> I[Log Security Event]
    I --> J[Increment Security Metrics]
    J --> K[Reject Request]
```

Security integration maintains permission chains, logs security events, tracks security metrics, and rejects requests that fail any validation step in the security chain.
